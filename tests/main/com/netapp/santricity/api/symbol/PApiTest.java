     * This command provides a programmatic means of powering off a storage array The operation is performed as gracefully as possible. Once this command is received, all open sockets, except for those that have in-process commands, are closed, meaning that any new SYMbol commands attempted will receive an RPC error. SYMbol commands that are in-process when this command is received are allowed to continue execution. In-process SYMbol commands in the \&quot;active\&quot; category are guaranteed to complete; In-process commands in the \&quot;passive\&quot; category may complete, but there is no guarantee. This command returns and reports status just prior to the actual power down event. Authentication is required for this command.
